I am sure you can thank someone for letting you be at this stance. In the final page of this assignment, add a line to the final page to thank someone special, anyone that comes to your mind. Iâ€™m serious about this! Pause for a moment, think of someone you'd like to thank for their presence in your life and for the wonderful life you lead, and add that as a comment or a tag in your HTML page on this or the next page. And, I am not referring the mythical one we have been working on in this lab, it is you. You've traversed this far with bravery, seeking aid when needed, gathering the necessary tools, and honing your skills. Take a moment to glance back and ponder your journey thus far. By the due date of this assignment, you'll be nearing the midterm." required></textarea>
